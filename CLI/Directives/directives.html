 In Tailwind CSS, the @ rule is used for various functionalities like custom directives, managing utilities, and defining conditional styles. Some common uses of the @ rule in Tailwind include:
 @import: "To use a custom font in your project, you can add an @import rule to bring in the font stylesheet from Google Fonts."

@apply: "Instead of repeatedly applying utility classes like px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500, you can create a custom class using the @apply directive to keep your CSS more maintainable."

@layer: "If you want to extend Tailwind's utility classes with your own custom styles, you can define them in a new @layer utilities block."

@variants: "To create a custom variant for hover states, you can use the @variants directive to apply different styles when the element is hovered."

@screen: "In Tailwind, the @screen directive allows you to apply responsive styles for different screen sizes, ensuring your design adapts to various devices."

Each example showcases how the @ rule is utilized to make styling more flexible and organized in Tailwind.
